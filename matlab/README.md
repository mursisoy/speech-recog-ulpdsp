Original speaker recognition algorithm in matlab. In these scripts we try to find the best algorithm to distiguish voice commands from our pool of speakers.

Before running add /lib to path.

voice_comp.m shows how a cepstrum map is obtained from a voice sample. 

mapcomp.m returns the distance vector between two cepstrum maps.
